## Reporting a vulnerability

To report a security problem goto [issues](https://github.com/dsorlov/swemail) and search so no one else already have reported it, then open a [new](https://github.com/dsorlov/swemail/issues/new) and tag it using the `Security` tag. I will prioritize reports having this tag.
