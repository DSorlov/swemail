Svensk Postutdelning / Swedish Post Delivery
============================================

A small and simple integration to provide information about delivery days for Postnord and Citymail in any swedish postal code.

## Install using HACS

* If you haven't already you must have [HACS installed](https://hacs.xyz/docs/setup/download).
* Go into HACS and search for HASL under the Integrations headline. You will need to restart Home Assistant to finish the process.
* Once that is done reload your GUI (caching issues preventing the integration to be shown).
* Goto Integrations and add Svensk Postutdelning.
* Enter postal code and select your providers
* Enjoy!
